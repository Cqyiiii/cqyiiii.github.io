I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/6985.htm). Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Tsinghua University, majoring in Industrial Engineering with a minor in Data Science and Engineering.



My research interests span causal inference, machine learning, and network science. I am particularly focused on experimental design and estimation for complex treatments, such as those involving interference or functional treatments. My goal is to develop effective, scalable, sample-efficient, and easy-to-implement statistical methodologies to address practical challenges.
